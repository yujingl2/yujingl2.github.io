The original dataset for the main visualization is provided by <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if">Chicago Data Portal</a>. The number of injuries and the number of crashes are the vital variables to analyze the traffic. Also, the traffic crash by time will provide intuitive information for the public. It In order to use the latest data for a more accurate analysis, I create a <a href="https://github.com/yujingl2/yujingl2.github.io/blob/main/Traffic_Crashes_Subset_3.csv">data subset</a> only including the information I needed in year 2020 for the graph Traffic Crash by Time.</p><h2 id="chicago-traffic-crash-by-time">Chicago Traffic Crash by Time</h2><div class="float left" style="float:left;width:50%"><strong>Graph Type:</strong>

Both axis are allowed to change different variables. People can change the type of graph to meet different requirements as well. Bar charge can display relative numbers of multiple categories. Line chart can help people easily observe the changes over a certain period of time. Users can display a total of 12 different graphs by selecting the graph type, X-axis value and Y-axis Value in the list.</p><h2 id="contextual-visualizations">Contextual Visualizations</h2><h3 id="top-10-traffic-crashes-primary-contributory-cause">Top <!-- -->1<!-- -->0 <!-- -->Traffic Crashes Primary Contributory Cause</h3><img src=" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yujingl2/yujingl2.github.io/main/cause_10.png" alt="10 cause"/><p>The dataset of this visualization is the same with main visualization which is provided by <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if">Chicago Data Portal</a>. I only use the crashes in year 2020 as my dataset and created this visualization by using python, the .ipynb file can be found <a href=" https://github.com/yujingl2/yujingl2.github.io/blob/main/TOP%2010%20Primary%20Crash%20Causes.ipynb">here</a>.
This visualization shows the top 10 traffic crashes primary contributory cause in Chicago. The top 1 is undetermined cause. For the purpose of this visualization, I think we can ignore this data and only analyze the accidents with explainable primary cause. The most common factors which was most significant in causing the crash is failing to yield the right-of-way and the second is following too closely. These two causes are due to human error which are preventable. People can know when is Chicago traffic the worse and reduce the risk of traffic accident by avoiding the possible causes by using this visualization in conjunction with the main visualization. </p><h3 id="pedestrian-and-bicycle-by-police-district-community-area">Pedestrian and Bicycle by Police District-Community Area</h3><img src="https://www.autoaccessoriesgarage.com/img/feature-articles/traffic-collisions/pedestrians_and_bike_collisions.png" alt="pedestrian and bike"/><p>The dataset of this visualization is <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-People/u6pd-qa9d">Traffic Crashes – People</a> which is provided by Chicago Data Portal. According to the research<a title="Chicago Traffic Accidents &amp; Crash, Auto Accessories Garage" href=" https://www.autoaccessoriesgarage.com/chicago-traffic-accidents-mapped#workscited ">[<!-- -->1<!-- -->]</a>, pedestrians and cyclists are more likely to be injured in an accident than car drivers and passengers. Pedestrians suffer the most with bicyclists coming in a close second with 90.5% and 64.5% of traffic accidents causing injuries respectively. Only 8.86% of collisions resulting in injury for the accidents involving neither pedestrians nor cycling. Therefore, we should pay attention the pedestrian and bicyclist as well.</p><p>The Y-axis label of Pedestrian and Bicycle by Police District-Community Area visualization shows the both police district and community area information. For example, “18th - Lincoln Park, Near North Side” means the 18 police district and its corresponding neighborhood is Lincoln Park, Near North Side. The visualization shows that top 5 most pedestrian and bicycle collision are community areas around the Lincoln Park, West Town, Lakeview, The Loop, and Logan Square. People can easily catch the different of pedestrian collisions or bicycle collisions for each two areas.</p><div id="references"><h1>References</h1><ol><li><a href=" https://www.autoaccessoriesgarage.com/chicago-traffic-accidents-mapped#workscited " target="_blank">Chicago Traffic Accidents &amp; Crash</a>, <!-- -->Auto Accessories Garage<!-- -->.<em></em></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div>
